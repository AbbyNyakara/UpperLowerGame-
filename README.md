# UpperLowerGame-
This is the code for an upper lower game. 
You can check the game out at the following website: http://www.higherlowergame.com/

THE WAY THE GAME WORKS:
P/S For the official online higher lower game, it will guess the number of searches. 

for this code, i used the number of instagram followers to check who has more followers, but with the same analogy. 
 Please note that the code is commented and you can easily follow through
 1. The code randomly generates two accounts. (The accounts are dictionaries nested in a list.)
 2. Then it is outputted into a printable format
 3. It then  asks the user for a guess 
 4. It then compares the user's guess versus the actual accounts in question to see whether the user has made the correct guess. 
 5. If the user has guessed correct, the user gets +1 that is incremented and this will exit and display the final score if the user has made the wrong guess.
